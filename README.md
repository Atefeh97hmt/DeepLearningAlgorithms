# Deep Learning Algorithms

## 1. Perceptron Algorithm Implementation (Perceptron.py)
This file contains a Python implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, a simple linear classifier used for binary classification tasks.
The Perceptron is a single-layer neural network capable of learning simple linear patterns. It is often used as a building block for more complex neural networks.
The implementation provided here includes the following components:
- Perceptron class: This class represents the Perceptron model. It includes methods for training the model (fit), making predictions (predict), and activating the neuron (activation).
- Training data: Example training data (X_train) and corresponding labels (y_train) are provided in the example usage section.

## 2. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Implementation (MultilayerPerceptron(MLP).py)
This file contains a Python implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a feedforward neural network capable of learning complex patterns.
The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network with one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers. It is capable of learning non-linear relationships in data and is widely used in various machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.
The implementation provided here includes the following components:
- MLP class: This class represents the Multilayer Perceptron model. It includes methods for forward propagation (forward_propagation), backward propagation (backward_propagation), training the model (fit), and making predictions (predict).
- Activation function: The sigmoid activation function is used in this implementation.
- Training data: Example training data (X_train) and corresponding labels (y_train) are provided in the example usage section.
