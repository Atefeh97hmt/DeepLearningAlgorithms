## 1. Perceptron Algorithm Implementation (Perceptron.py)
This file contains a Python implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, a simple linear classifier used for binary classification tasks.
The Perceptron is a single-layer neural network capable of learning simple linear patterns. It is often used as a building block for more complex neural networks.
The implementation provided here includes the following components:
- Perceptron class: This class represents the Perceptron model. It includes methods for training the model (fit), making predictions (predict), and activating the neuron (activation).
- Training data: Example training data (X_train) and corresponding labels (y_train) are provided in the example usage section.
